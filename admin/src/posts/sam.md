Enable everyone to use services without app downloads, signups, logins. Securing their data on device, never compromised in a cloud.
* By services I mean things like the next Uber or Deliveroo or AirBnb.. wtv business comes along
* Think of it as the App Store 2.0, like WeChat but open, public and decentralized

Anecdotally, I’m working on all the components to make this work as open source projects for a few reasons, 1 is trust because anyone can look at the code, 2 is because I believe this technology is democratizing and will enable the world to overcome all the grifting that companies do today like taking transaction fees on any and all interactions with services…

The reason why I say AppStore 2.0 also is because this project would be a new form of development platform, where devs can contribute code to the application directly and get paid through the platform, taking on the reverse approach than Apple where they distribute fees to devs and take a cut, here the people who pay for services give a fee directly to the developers that built it.
