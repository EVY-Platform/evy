# Data types

### Built in types used on EVY

```
uuid
string
enum
int
float
boolean
timestamp
```

### Types have strict validation at the database level

-   eg a uuid has to match the format for a UUID V4
-   eg a timestamp has to be a valid unix timestamp

### Wrappers

-   number = int or float
