Dev tools - WIP

## Setup
A Dockerfile and docker-compose setup was started to attempt to get builds with live code reloads and such but the performance is so bad and images so huge with Rust that this has prooved to be impractical. Maybe a better mind than mine can figure things out (:

If you intend to modify models, you need to install quicktype as well `npm install -g quicktype` (required node and npm)
If you're on mac you also need to install gsed `brew install gnu-sed`
